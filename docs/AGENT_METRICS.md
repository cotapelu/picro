## Iteration Log

| Round | Date       | Focus                          | Tests Pass | Regressions | Rollbacks |
|-------|------------|--------------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1      | 2026-06-11 | Outer loop & follow-up support | 1912       | 0           | 0         |
| 2      | 2026-06-11 | Per-tool execution mode override | 1915       | 0           | 0         |
| 3      | 2026-06-11 | Terminate flag support         | 1919       | 0           | 0         |

## Quality Indicators

- **Test Failure Rate**: <1% (1919/1934 tests passing, 14 skipped, 1 todo)
- **Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)**: < 5 min (fast fix of test failures)
- **Rollback Count**: 0
- **Coverage**: Not measured (TODO)

## Observations

- Initial implementation of follow-up support caused one test failure due to edge case in `shouldContinue` handling. Fixed quickly.
- No performance regressions detected.
- Code complexity remains manageable.
